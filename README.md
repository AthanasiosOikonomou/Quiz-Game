# Quiz-Game

I created this game as side project to learn how to use gui on and API requests.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Consouldenature/Quiz-Game.git`

i. main.py is the main code file used for the game.
ii. data.py is the request for the questions.
iii. question_model.py is the setting our questions/ answers.
iv. quiz_brain.py is for checking the answers, next questions and we answered all the questions.
v. ui.py is for setting the gui

# Notes

1) The game is taking the questions from 'https://opentdb.com/api.php'.
2) The game have 10 questions each time.
3) After 10 questions the buttons get disabled.
